                <p className="text-sm text-justify py-4">
                  EIMS has developed the Computer Science Program with the
                  primary intention to develop the studentsâ€™ lateral
                  professional thinking and intuitive skills. The curriculum has
                  been formulated with a balanced mixture of theory and
                  practical experiences at initial and advanced level to equip
                  the graduates with professional core competencies so that they
                  can cater to the challenging needs of corporate sector of
                  computer science in national and global scenario.
                  Consequently, the graduate will be able to achieve the
                  significant positions in both private and public sector
                  organizations at development and planning levels. In short,
                  graduates will be able to assimilate the following outcomes as
                  a basis of a successful academic Program in Computer Science.
